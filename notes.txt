The application infrastructure is built on:-
- Postgres
- Redis
- NextJs

I implemented to API endpoints, to do the following:-
- /api/shorten  ->  To shorten provided urls and provide a shorten url
- /api/retrieve ->  Return the destination url given a specific code

I implemented a layer of cache using redis to ensure that subsequent url retrievals are much faster and we also don't
overload the database with a flory of requests to the application.

For our code generation, we are using the b62 algorithm and the current EPOCH timestamp to generate a code for the
provided url.

The whole application is packaged in a docker environment that houses the database, cache and the application server.
We are using docker compose to orchestrate all the required services for the application.
